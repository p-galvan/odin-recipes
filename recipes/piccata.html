    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Chicken piccata is super quick and easy to make with pounded chicken breasts and a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>    
    <br>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds. Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
        </ol>
